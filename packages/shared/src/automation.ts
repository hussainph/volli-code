 * Automations V1 (VC-112, tracer VC-126): the record's domain vocabulary.
 *
 * An Automation is a saved, named way of starting work — its Instructions and
 * its Runtime, with Triggers arriving in a later slice. One Run opens one
 * fresh chat Session; the Run row remembers which Automation and which
 * *resolved* model and reasoning produced that Session.
 *
 * Pure and shared on purpose, like `model-access-policy.ts` beside it: main
 * stores these records and validates writes; the renderer's editor reads the
 * same words, so a rule that existed in only one process would be two
 * policies wearing one name. Transport stays out — the Electron channel
 * catalog is desktop-owned (docs/BOUNDARIES.md), so nothing here names IPC.
